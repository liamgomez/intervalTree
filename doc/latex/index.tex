This program contains a total of three classes -- An interval class with low and high data members -- An interval Node class with left, right, and parent node pointers. Aswell as max and color data members. -- Interval Tree class for the tree implementation, containing a root and N\-I\-L node pointers.

Everything is tested and appears to be working properly, main program runs through the various operations that can be preformed on the tree.
